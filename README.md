# Roadmap

* setup apache with php in a docker container
* add storage in local file to build an app that sum numbers posted by the client
* add redis persistence
* turn this into a chat application
    * using very basic short polling: setInterval and clearInterval to prevent a bit being refreshed while typing.
    * Ajax (using the new fetchAPI): better short polling, not disturbing the input process.
    * use different colors for different users.
